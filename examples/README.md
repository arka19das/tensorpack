Training examples with __reproducible performance__.

__The word "reproduce" should always mean reproduce performance__.
With the magic of SGD, wrong deep learning code often appears to work, especially if you try it on toy datasets.
Github is full of deep learning code that "implements" but does not "reproduce"
methods, and you'll not know whether the implementation is actually correct.
